      <p>
        I wanted to include this message in order to show you how much I really do love and appreciate you.
        I don’t think I say it enough, but you really are the best thing that has happened to me in my life. Like, before you,
        I was honestly a robot who wouldn’t talk to people and would only play Deepwoken. I wasn’t confident at all. I hated
        the way I acted and looked. But now that I am with you, I actually feel like myself. You have brought a side out of me
        I really didn’t think that I would be able to see. I want you to know that I love you so much, and you mean so much to
        me. Like, without you, I don’t know what I would be doing with myself. I love you, Emily. I will tell you every day if
        I need to.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I just want to say as well that I am obsessed with you, the way you talk, the way you look, the way you walk, the
        way you do anything. You’re always on my mind, and I can’t stop thinking about you, even if I tried. When I am doing
        something in school, I just think about what you’re doing. I do really feel bad whenever I make you upset; it hurts my
        chest, and I hate thinking about it. Seeing you happy is literally the only thing I want. I look forward to seeing you
        and talking to you. You are literally the highlight of all my days.
      </p>
      <p>I love you Emily, thank you for being a part of my life.</p>
